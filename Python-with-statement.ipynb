The statement itself initializes a resource and associates a variable with that resource.  In our example, the resource is a file and we associate it with the variable `f`. Then the block of statements the `with` delimits---the block following the colon and indented from the `with`---is the **scope** of the variable.  As soon as control leaves the block inside the `with`, whether due to an exception, a `return` from a function, or simply completing the last statement in the block, the resource is closed."
